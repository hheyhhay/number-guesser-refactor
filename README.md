### HTML Rubric
#### 4: 
- [ ] Developers use [BEM](http://getbem.com/), [SMACCS](http://smacss.com/), or another set of naming conventions for classes.
- [ ] Application fully implements HTML that is accessible for individuals with visual disabilities. Note: This is checked using Chrome DevTools [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) audit tool.
#### 3:
- [ ] Application utilizes consistent naming for HTML classes and IDs, and follows suggested conventions. Example: classes should be named using kabab-case, ids should be used sparingly
#### 2:
- [ ] Application uses an appropriate amount of [HTML semantic elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Document_and_website_structure). Semantic elements like `<button>`, `<li>`, etc. are used instead of `<div>` or `<span>`. If `<div>` or `<span>` elements are used, they are only for styling purposes.
